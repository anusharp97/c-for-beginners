# If you're a beginner in the C language or want to practice there is some challanges for you to train your C! #

## How to compile and run C code? ##
You can run C code using gcc.exe file. You can find it by downloading mingw (mingw32\bin\gcc.exe).

Using (I'm recommend to add mingw32\bin to your path for using it in this way):
```batch
  gcc your_c_code.c
```
(The output usually is a.exe)
You can write one short batch script that compiles and run your code! It'll save your time:
```batch
gcc your_c_code.c
a.exe
```

For example go call this file run.bat and after you create it you can open cmd window in the same location and just type:
```batch
run
```
To compile and run this code!.

### Note: I'm working on new challanges (Target 999 challanges: 11 Done) ### <- Please change this after adding new chanllanges
